# social_media_sdp4
pilot project for sdp4
This is Social media app which me and my mates created for academic purposes. Mostly built by learning from youtube tutorials. 
The app has the following features-
1.Login Authentication using firebase
2. Creating User profile like most social media sites
3. Post pictures and blogs 
4. Has options to like and comment on them
5. Messaging options

It was a project for the purpose of completing Software Development IV Course offered by my university.
